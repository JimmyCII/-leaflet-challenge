# Leaflet Earthquake Visualization Challenge

This project aims to develop an interactive visualization of earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS collects vast amounts of data daily, including earthquake information worldwide. The goal is to present this complex data in a clear, engaging, and informative way, suitable for both public education and professional use.

## Project Overview

This challenge involves using the Leaflet JavaScript library to create a dynamic map displaying earthquake data. The project is broken down into two parts:

**Part 1: Basic Earthquake Visualization**

*   Fetches earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.
*   Displays earthquake locations on a Leaflet map using markers.
*   Marker size represents the earthquake's magnitude.
*   Marker color indicates the earthquake's depth.
*   Includes popups with detailed information about each earthquake.
*   Provides a legend to explain the map's color-coding and sizing.

**Part 2: (Optional) Advanced Visualization with Tectonic Plates**

*   Overlays tectonic plate data from GitHub onto the same map.
*   Adds different base map options for users to choose from.
*   Allows users to toggle earthquake data and tectonic plate data layers independently.
*   Implements layer controls to manage map visibility.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories within the repository:

*   `Leaflet-Part-1`: Contains the code for the basic earthquake visualization.
*   `Leaflet-Part-2`: Contains the code for the optional advanced visualization with tectonic plates.

Each part should contain the necessary HTML and JavaScript files to run the analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the appropriate folder (`Leaflet-Part-1` or `Leaflet-Part-2`) within your terminal.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the visualization.

## Data Sources

*   **Earthquake Data:** USGS GeoJSON Feed (see instructions for link)
*   **Tectonic Plate Data:** https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   JavaScript
*   Leaflet JavaScript Library
*   GeoJSON

## Motivation

This project was undertaken to develop a user-friendly way to visualize USGS earthquake data. The interactive map aims to educate the public and stakeholders on seismic activity, as well as potentially showcasing the critical role of the USGS in studying our planet.
